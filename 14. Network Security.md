Examples of hardware appliances include:

* Firewall appliance: The firewall allows and blocks connections based on a predefined set of rules. It restricts what can enter and what can leave a network.
* Intrusion Detection System (IDS) appliance: An IDS detects system and network intrusions and intrusion attempts. It tries to detect attackersâ€™ attempts to break into your network.
* Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) appliance: An IPS blocks detected intrusions and intrusion attempts. It aims to prevent attackers from breaking into your network.
* Virtual Private Network (VPN) concentrator appliance: A VPN ensures that the network traffic cannot be read nor altered by a third party. It protects the confidentiality (secrecy) and integrity of the sent data.

On the other hand, we have software security solutions. Common examples are:

* Antivirus software: You install an antivirus on your computer or smartphone to detect malicious files and block them from executing.
* Host firewall: Unlike the firewall appliance, a hardware device, a host firewall is a program that ships as part of your system, or it is a program that you install on your system. For instance, MS Windows includes Windows Defender Firewall, and Apple macOS includes an application firewall; both are host firewalls
