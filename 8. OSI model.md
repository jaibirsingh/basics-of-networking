# OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection is an absolute fundamental model used in networking.

## 7 layers of OSI model
At every layer, specific processes take place and add pieces of information to the data travelling through that layer. This process is called **Encapsulation**.

### Layer 7. Application
* Here protocols and rules are in place to determine how the user should interact with data sent or received.
* Eg: email clients, browser, or file server browsing software such as FileZilla

### Layer 6. Presentation
* Here standardistation starts to take place.
* Standardisation is necessary because software developers can make their softwares differently but there is a need of uniformity when it comes to dtaa transmission.
* This layers = Translator for = data to and from the layer 7.
* Eg: When you send an email, the other user may have another email client to you, but the contents of the email will still need to display the same.
* Security features such as data encryption (like HTTPS when visiting a secure site) occur at this layer.

### Layer 5. Session
Once data has been correctly translated or formatted from the presentation layer (layer 6), the session layer (layer 5) will begin to create a connection to the other computer that the data is destined for. When a connection is established, a session is created. Whilst this connection is active, so is the session.
***
* The session layer (layer 5) synchronises the two computers to ensure that they are on the same page before data is sent and received
*  Once these checks are in place, the session layer will begin to divide up the data sent into smaller chunks of data and begin to send these chunks (packets) one at a time.
*  This dividing up is beneficial because if the connection is lost, only the chunks that weren't yet sent will have to be sent again — not the entire piece of the data.
*  What is worthy of noting is that sessions are unique — meaning that data cannot travel over different sessions, but in fact, only across each session instead.

### Layer 4. Transport
* When data is sent between devices, it follows one of two different protocols that are decided based upon several factors:
  1. TCP
  2. UDP

  **1. TCP**
  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented protocol requiring a TCP three-way-handshake to establish a connection.
  ***
  * This protocol reserves a constant connection between the two devices for the amount of time it takes for the data to be sent and received.
  * **Advantages**:  TCP incorporates error checking into its design. Error checking is how TCP can guarantee that data sent from the small chunks in the session layer (layer 5) has then been received and reassembled in the same order.
  * **Disadvantages**:
    * Requires a reliable connection between the two devices. If one small chunk of data is not received, then the entire chunk of data cannot be used.
    * A slow connection can bottleneck another device as the connection will be reserved on the receiving computer the whole time.
  * **Usage** : TCP is used for situations such as file sharing, internet browsing or sending an email. This usage is because these services require the data to be accurate and complete.
 
   **2. UDP**
  * User Datagram Protocol is much faster than TCP. It does not reserve a continuous connection with a device.
  * It doesn't care if the data is received. Unstable connection.
  * Usage:  Wherever small pieces of data has to be sent.
    * Protocols used for discovering devices (ARP/ DHCP)
    * Video streaming, where it is okay if some part of the video is pixelated)   

 ### Layer 3. Network
 This is where the magic of routing & re-assembly of data takes place (from these small chunks to the larger chunk). At this layer, everything is dealt with via IP addresses 
 ***
 * Firstly, routing simply determines the most optimal path in which these chunks of data should be sent. This is done by using some protocols like:
   * OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
   * RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
   Factors to decide the routing path:
    * What path is the shortest? I.e. has the least amount of devices that the packet needs to travel across.
    * What path is the most reliable? I.e. have packets been lost on that path before?
    * Which path has the faster physical connection? I.e. is one path using a copper connection (slower) or a fibre (considerably faster)?
  ***
 * **Why a router is called Layer 3 devices?**
   
   Devices such as routers capable of delivering packets using IP addresses are known as Layer 3 devices — because they are capable of working at the third layer of the OSI model.

### Layer 2. Data Link
It's the job of the data link layer to present the data in a format suitable for transmission. When information is sent across a network, it's actually the physical address that is used to identify where exactly to send the information.
***
* It receives a packet from the network layer (including the IP address for the remote computer) and adds in the physical MAC (Media Access Control) address of the receiving endpoint.
* Where does MAC address come from? =  Inside every network-enabled computer is a Network Interface Card (NIC) which comes with a unique MAC address to identify it.
* Can we change MAC addresses?
  = MAC addresses are set by the manufacturer and literally burnt into the card; they can't be changed -- although they can be spoofed.

### Layer 1. Physical
* This layer references the physical components of the hardware used in networking and is the lowest layer that you will find.
* Devices use electrical signals to transfer data between each other in a binary numbering system (1's and 0's).
For example, ethernet cables connecting devices.
