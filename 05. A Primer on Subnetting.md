# Subnetting (Yet to be explored further)
It is splitting of a network into smaller networks

## Example
A cafe will have two networks:

1. One for employees, cash registers, and other devices for the facility
2. One for the general public to use as a hotspot

Subnets use IP addresses in three different ways:

1. Identify the network address
2. Identify the host address
3. Identify the default gateway
Let's split these three up to understand their purposes into the table below:


## Network Address 
* This address identifies the start of the actual network and is used to identify a network's existence.
* For example, a device with the IP address of 192.168.1.100 will be on the network identified by 192.168.1.0

## Host Address
* An IP address here is used to identify a device on the subnet
* For example, a device will have the network address of 192.168.1.1 Eg:192.168.1.100

## Default Gateway
* The default gateway address is a special address assigned to a device on the network that is capable of sending information to another network 
* Any data that needs to go to a device that isn't on the same network (i.e. isn't on 192.168.1.0) will be sent to this device. These devices can use any host address but usually use either the first or last host address in a network (.1 or .254)
192.168.1.254
