# UDP/IP

UDP is a stateless protocol that doesn't require a constant connection between the two devices for data to be sent. For example, the Three-way handshake does not occur, nor is there any synchronisation between the two devices.
***

UDP packets are much simpler than TCP packets and have fewer headers. However, both protocols share some standard headers, which are what is annotated in the table below:

* **Time to Live (TTL)**: This field sets an expiry timer for the packet, so it doesn't clog up your network if it never manages to reach a host or escape!
* **Source Address**:	The IP address of the device that the packet is being sent from, so that data knows where to return to.
* **Destination Address**:	The device's IP address the packet is being sent to so that data knows where to travel next.
* **Source Port**:	This value is the port that is opened by the sender to send the UDP packet from. This value is randomly chosen (out of the ports from 0-65535 that aren't already in use at the time).
* **Destination Port**: 	This value is the port number that an application or service is running on the remote host (the one receiving the data); for example, a webserver running on port 80. Unlike the source port, this value is not chosen at random.
* **Data**:	This header is where data, i.e. bytes of a file that is being transmitted, is stored.
