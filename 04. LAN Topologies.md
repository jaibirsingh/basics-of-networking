# LAN topologies

Topology = Design or look of the network at hand.

## Star topology

* Devices are individually connected via a central netwroking device such as a switch or a hub.
* Advantages = Scalable
* Disadvantages = High cost, Central point of failure

## Bus topology

* It relies on a single connection known as a backbone cable.
* Advantages: Cost efficient
* Disadvantages: Single point of failure,i.e. Backbone cable + Slow as single path is shared by all the devices to transmit data, hence prone to bottlenecks

## Ring/ Token topology
* Works by sending the data across the loop until it reaches the destined device.
* Any device sending data further will send only if it itself doesn't have nay data to send.
* Advantages: Les prone to bottlenecks + Cost-efficient + Easy to troubleshoot as data flows in one direction.
* Disadvantages: Inefficient way to transmit data as it may have to visist the devices where it is not supposed to go.

## What is a switch??
* Dedicated devices that aggregate multip[le devices such as computers, printers or any netwroking-capable device using ethernet
* Switches can connect a large number of devices by having ports of 4,8,16,24,32 and 64 for devices to plug into.
* Switches >> efficient>> Counterparts like Hubs, repeaters.
* Switches keep track of what device is connected to which port. ==> So when they receive a packet, instead of repeating that packet to every port,
  like  a hub would do, it just sends it to the intended target ==> reduces network traffic.

## What is a Router??
* It connects networks and pass data between them
* Routing is useful when devices are connected by many paths.
  
## Connect switches and routers
* This will increase the redundancy (reliability). If on path fails, another can be used.
* Internet <---> Router#1 <---> Switch#1 <---> Devices in the network
