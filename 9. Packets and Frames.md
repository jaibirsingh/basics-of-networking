# Packets and Frames
* Frame is encapsulated inside a packet (Can be said to understand the concept)
* Packets and Frames = Both small pieces of data
* Frame = Without IP
* Packet = With IP
* Note: Packets have different structures that are dependant upon the type of packet that is being sent. Networking is full of standards and protocols that act as a set of rules for how the packet is handled on a device.
* Example of the Internet Protocol. A packet using this protocol will have a set of headers that contain additional pieces of information to the data that is being sent across a network.

  Some notable headers include:
  
  **Time to Live**	This field sets an expiry timer for the packet to not clog up your network if it never manages to reach a host or escape!
  
  **Checksum**	This field provides integrity checking for protocols such as TCP/IP. If any data is changed, this value will be different from what was expected and therefore corrupt.
  
  **Source Address**	The IP address of the device that the packet is being sent from so that data knows where to return to.
  
  **Destination Address**	The device's IP address the packet is being sent to so that data knows where to travel next.
