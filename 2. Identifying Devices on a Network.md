# Identifying devices on a Network
Generally there are two ways to identufy a device on a network:
1. IP address
2. MAC address

## IP addresses
* An IP address is divided into four octets. This number is calculated through a technique known as IP addressing and subnetting.
* NOTE: IP addresses can change from device to device but cannot be active simultaneously more than once within the same network.
* How do device communicate? IP addresses follow a set of standards known as protocols. These protocols are the backbone of networking and drives most of the devices to communicate in the same language.
* When do IP addresses become public or private? Devices can be on both a private and a public network. Depending on where they are will determine what type of IP address they have.
* Public IP addresses are given by ISP.
* Two devices connected on private network --> Use their IP addresses to communicate with each other.
* When any data is sent to the internet, the same two devices will be identified asd the same by the public Ip given to them by the ISP.
* IPv4 = 2^32 = 4.29 billion addresses. but the problem is estimated 50 billion devices connected on the internet. Looks like: 86.164.23.11
* IPv6 = 2^128 = 340 trillion+ addresses solves the problem. Looks like: 2a00:22c4:a531:c500:425f:cce6:c36b:f64d

## MAC addresses
Devices on a network have a physical network interface = A microchip found on the device's motherboard. Network INterface has a unique address (like a serial number) assigned to it by its manufacturer.

*MAC(Media Access Control) = 12 character hexadeciaml number -> split intow two's and separated by a colon. eg: a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d
* Out of the 12 characters -> First 6 for the manufacturer and last 6 -> A unique number.
* What is SPOOFING? The process with which MAC addresses can be faked, and a networked device pretends to identify as another usng MAC address.
