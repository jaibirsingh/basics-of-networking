# Ports

When a connection has been established (recalling from the OSI model's room), any data sent or received by a device will be sent through these ports. In computing, ports are a numerical value between 0 and 65535 (65,535).  Any port that is within 0 and 1024 (1,024) is known as a common port.
***

**1. File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**	21	This protocol is used by a file-sharing application built on a client-server model, meaning you can download files from a central location.

**2. Secure Shell (SSH)**	22	This protocol is used to securely login to systems via a text-based interface for management.

**3. HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**	80	This protocol powers the World Wide Web (WWW)! Your browser uses this to download text, images and videos of web pages.

**4. HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**		443	This protocol does the exact same as above; however, securely using encryption.

**5. Server Message Block (SMB)**	445	This protocol is similar to the File Transfer Protocol (FTP); however, as well as files, SMB allows you to share devices like printers.

**6. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**	3389	This protocol is a secure means of logging in to a system using a visual desktop interface (as opposed to the text-based limitations of the SSH protocol).
