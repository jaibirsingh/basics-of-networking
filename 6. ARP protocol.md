# ARP Protocol

The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is the technology responsible that let devices identify themselves on a network.
This means with ARP, a device associate its MAC address with an IP address on the network.

***

* Each device --> has a log --> containing MAC addresses associated with other devices on the same network.

## How do devices communicate within a network?
* When devices wish to communicate with another, they will send a broadcast to the entire network searching for the specific device.
* Devices can use the ARP protocol to find the MAC address (and therefore the physical identifier) of a device for communication.

## How does ARP work?
* **Cache**: Each device within a network has a ledger to store information on.
* In the context of the ARP, this cache stores the identifiers of other devices on the network (IP and MAC address)

* In order to map these two identifiers together (IP address and MAC address), the ARP protocol sends two types of messages:

ARP Request
ARP Reply
When an ARP request is sent, a message is broadcasted to every other device found on a network by the device, asking whether or not the device's MAC address matches the requested IP address. If the device does have the requested IP address, an ARP reply is returned to the initial device to acknowledge this. The initial device will now remember this and store it within its cache (an ARP entry). 

This process is illustrated in the diagram below:

1. What category of ARP Packet asks a device whether or not it has a specific IP address? : request
2. What address is used as a physical identifier for a device on a network? : MAC address
3. What address is used as a logical identifier for a device on a network? : IP address
