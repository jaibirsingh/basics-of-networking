# TCP-IP (Three-way handshake)

* Similar to OSI model, but arguably a summarised version of the OSI model.
* Very similar to how the OSI model works, information is added to each layer of the TCP model as the piece of data (or packet) traverses it. This process is known as encapsulation - where the reverse of this process is decapsulation.
* It has four layers:
  1. Application
  2. Transport
  3. Internet
  4. Network Interface

* One defining feature of TCP is that it is connection-based, which means that TCP must establish a connection between both a client and a device acting as a server before data is sent.
* Because of this, TCP guarantees that any data sent will be received on the other end. This process is named the Three-way handshake
* TCP packets contain various sections of information known as headers that are added from encapsulation. Let's explain some of the crucial headers in the table below:

    * **Source Port**	This value is the port opened by the sender to send the TCP packet from. This value is chosen randomly (out of the ports from 0-65535 that aren't already in use at the time).
    * **Destination Port**	This value is the port number that an application or service is running on the remote host (the one receiving data); for example, a webserver running on port 80. Unlike the source port, this value is not chosen at random.
    * **Source IP**	This is the IP address of the device that is sending the packet.
    * **Destination IP**	This is the IP address of the device that the packet is destined for.
    * **Sequence Number**	When a connection occurs, the first piece of data transmitted is given a random number.
    * **Acknowledgement Number**	After a piece of data has been given a sequence number, the number for the next piece of data will have the sequence number + 1. 
    * **Checksum**	This value is what gives TCP integrity. A mathematical calculation is made where the output is remembered. When the receiving device performs the mathematical calculation, the data must be corrupt if the output is different from what was sent.
    * **Data**	This header is where the data, i.e. bytes of a file that is being transmitted, is stored.
    * **Flag**	This header determines how the packet should be handled by either device during the handshake process. Specific flags will determine specific behaviours.
 
* SYN - Client: Here's my Initial Sequence Number(ISN) to SYNchronise with (0)
  
  SYN/ACK - Server: Here's my Initial Sequence Number (ISN) to SYNchronise with (5,000), and I ACKnowledge your initial number sequence (0)
  
  ACK - Client: I ACKnowledge your Initial Sequence Number (ISN) of (5,000), here is some data that is my ISN+1 (0 + 1)
